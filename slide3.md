## Microservice Architecture - Operational Complexity

![scale:30%](./assets/images/photos/complexity.JPG)

</br>
Microservice architecture creates a unique set of challenges around:
* Discovery
* Configuration
* Segmentation

???

However, as in everything in life, there is trade offs that come with the benefits of a microservice design. Particularly there is added operational complexity for services around:
- Discovery
- Configuration
- Segmentation

A service mesh presents us a solution for the increased operation complexity of designing in a microservice world
