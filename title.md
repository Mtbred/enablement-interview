???

Purpose: Explaining the need for and the value that a service mesh, particularly Consul provides

Audience: Individuals with limited to no exposure to a service mesh or Consul, but may have an understand microservices conceptually. 

Today we'll be looking at what a service mesh is, the problem it solves and in particular Hashicorp's Consul

We will start by painting a picture of monolith application design.

This will set the stage for why development has moved away from this approach towards microservice architecture. 

Finally we'll talk about how a service mesh, particularly Consul, steps in to handle the complexity that comes with microservices and look at one quick example of a way that Consul approaches the complexity.
